# The-Aroha-Box-Project
I am making a aroha box (Bento Box) we are doing this so that we can team up with the cooking classes to produce food that we can give to people who maybe don't have that kind stuff at home the reason we picked to do this in a bento box style is because we want to be able to separate foods so that if in one person in the family hates chicken, is vegetarian or is allergic to that food it can be separated out and then the whole family can  be happy we are planning to make this box as biodegradable as we can so that it does not produce too much waste we are planning to put utensils such as forks knives and chopsticks with the bento box
